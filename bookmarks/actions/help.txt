Q: I am getting confused with this concept.
can I understand that ContentType model which is a table as regular as we create in the project?
The ContentType table stores all apps and their models right?

A: Yes, that's correct. The ContentType model in Django represents a table that stores information about the models defined in your Django project.
Each row in the ContentType table represents a unique model, and contains information about the app that the model belongs to and the name of the model.

The ContentType model is used in Django's content-type framework, which allows you to store generic foreign keys that can refer to any model in your project.
The ContentType table provides a way to map the name of a model to its database representation, so that generic foreign keys can be used to refer to instances of any model in the project.



ContentTypes - Databasedagi 1 ta table va u yerda projectdagi barcha apps va ular ichida yozilgan modellar haqida information saqlanadi.
Deylik, Bizda account appda Profile degan va images appda Image degan modellar bor.

Endi shular ContentType tableda quyidagicha ko'rinadi:

                        ContentType table

            |id(pk)|    |app_label|     |model|     |verb|
            1           account         Profile     profile
            2           images          Image        images
