                                            Logic of the followers feature

Q: how can I know the total number of followers who are following me?

A: To find the total number of followers who are following a specific Profile object,
you can use the followers field that was added to the Profile model in the same way that you used the following field to find the users that a Profile object is following.

For example, if you have a profile object representing the user you are interested in,
you can get the set of users that are following that profile object by calling profile.followers.all(),
and then find the total number of users in the set by calling .count() on the resulting queryset.

# Get the profile object for the user you are interested in
profile = Profile.objects.get(id=<profile_id>)

# Get the set of users that are following the profile object
followers = profile.followers.all()

# Find the total number of users in the set of followers
num_followers = followers.count()

# Print the total number of followers
print(f'Total number of followers: {num_followers}')









                                                Logic of the following feature
Question:
">>> i_following_users = user_1.following.exclude(id=user_1.id)
>>> i_following_users.count()
5
>>> i_following_users
<QuerySet [<Profile: mushtariy>, <Profile: xudoyorxon>, <Profile: mirshod_python>, <Profile: Abdulmalik>, <Profile: Sevara>]>
".
In this case, the user with id 1 is following 5 users right. Or 5 users are following him?

Answer:
In this case, user_1 is following 5 other users. The code first retrieves the set of users that user_1 is following by calling user_1.following,
and then excludes the user_1 object from that set using exclude(id=user_1.id).

This means that the resulting i_following_users queryset contains all the users that user_1 is following, except for user_1 itself.

Calling i_following_users.count() returns the number of users in the queryset, which in this case is 5, indicating that user_1 is following 5 other users.

The queryset is then printed using print(i_following_users), which outputs a list of the Profile objects that user_1 is following, excluding user_1 itself.
